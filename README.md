                                  Findings and conclusions on web scraping
   1. Reasoned Conclusions
   
 The web scraping process allowed us to obtain valuable data from the website, which enabled us to conduct further analysis. In the course of accomplishing this task, we were able to:

  - Automate data collection, which significantly reduces time and resources compared to manual collection.
  - Obtain structured data that is easy to analyze and visualize.
  - Process and transform the data for further analysis, including converting dates and splitting rows into multiple columns.
  - These steps provided meaningful insights into the problem under study because we were able to collect and 
    structure the information for further analysis.
    

   2. Recommendations and next steps
   
 Based on the analysis of the Python code and the collected data, the following steps can be suggested:

  Automate the scraping process: Create an automated system that will periodically collect data from websites. 
                                 This will allow to have up-to-date data for real-time analysis.
  Additional data processing: Implement additional data processing steps such as removing duplicates, 
                              filling in missing values and normalizing data.
  Data Analysis: Conduct in-depth analysis of collected data, including statistical analysis, data visualization, 
                 and application of machine learning techniques to identify hidden patterns.
  Change Monitoring: Create a system to track changes to websites and update data as needed.
  
  Documentation and Training: Create documentation of the web scraping process and train the team to ensure 
                              the project is sustainable and scalable.
                              
                              
    3. Limitations, possible improvements and areas for further research
    
 Despite the success in performing web scraping, a number of limitations and opportunities for improvement need to be considered:

  Legal and ethical aspects: It is important to ensure that the web scraping process complies with legal and 
                             ethical regulations, including compliance with the websites' terms of use and data privacy.
                             
  Changes to websites: Websites may change their structure, which will require updates to the scraping code. 
                       It is recommended to develop flexible and adaptive algorithms that can handle such changes.
                       
  Performance: Performance may be an issue when dealing with large amounts of data or frequent scraping. 
               Code optimization and use of distributed systems can help to cope with this problem.
